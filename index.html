    Welcome to VolunteerHub!
    </header>
        <p>This platform is created for teens, by teens (but is open to anyone) for everyone who wants to make a positive impact through volunteering, or is just looking for something to do, perhaps even to meet certain requirements (N(J)HS, Sponsored Hours, Volunteering Requirements, etc.)! Our firsthand experiences with various volunteering opportunities have inspired us to develop an improved application that goes beyond what's already out there. Our goal is to make volunteering more accessible, engaging, and rewarding for everyone!!!</p>
